						In every project is necessary to <span>listen</span> what people are saying and <span>ask</span>the
						right questions. On <span>UX</span> side, I'm fluent with most areas that the field offers, i
						love <span>minimal UI</span> and clean <span>typography</span>. Thanks to my experience as
						<span>dev</span> and <span>creative</span>, i can understand both creation sides of a digital
						product always keeping an eye on <span>business</span> and <span>costs</span> specifics. In the
						small projects, i can <span>lead</span> all the entire process without losing myself, with the
						big ones i can <span>manage</span> the project throught <span>AGILE</span> or <span>LEAN</span>
						methodology cooperating closely with the whole <span>team</span>.

						I have always tried to begin following a <span>content first</span> approach, so after the
						contents have been clarified i open <span>Sketch</span> to give a primal shape to the idea and
						to organize a sort of <span>mind map</span>. Once finally the idea has achieved a satisfying
						shape i always googling to check if i can introducing some new skill in my comfort zone or if
						it's better to hold off for a better time. Sometimes iâ€™ve used tools like <span>Adobe XD</span>
						or <span>Framer</span> to show some <span>POC</span> to the customers. After this, as a
						supporter of <span>JAMStack</span> architecture, i start with the tech side figuring out which
						<span>javascript</span> library or framework is better to achieve the specific goal. I like the
						flexibility of <span>React</span> and its whole ecosystem, <span>styled components</span> and
						the <span>stylesheet</span> declinations (obviously <span>SCSS</span> remain the king), all
						connected togheter by <span>headless API</span> with content managed through an
						<span>headless CMS</span> and released as <span>responsive</span> products ready for every
						touchpoint.
