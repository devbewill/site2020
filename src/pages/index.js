							In every project is necessary to <span>listen</span> what people are saying and{' '}

							that the field offers, i love <span>minimal UI</span> and clean <span>typography</span>.
							Thanks to my experience as <span>dev</span> and <span>creative</span>, i can understand both
							creation sides of a digital product always keeping an eye on <span>business</span> and{' '}
							<span>costs</span> specifics. In the small projects, i can <span>lead</span> all the entire
							process without losing myself, with the big ones i can <span>manage</span> the project
							throught <span>AGILE</span> or <span>LEAN</span> methodology cooperating closely with the
							whole <span>team</span>.

								I have always tried to begin following a <span>content first</span> approach, so after

								achieved a satisfying shape i always googling to check if i can introducing some new
								skill in my comfort zone or if it's better to hold off for a better time. Sometimes iâ€™ve
								used tools like <span>Adobe XD</span> or <span>Framer</span> to show some{' '}
								<span>POC</span> to the customers. After this, as a supporter of <span>JAMStack</span>{' '}
								architecture, i start with the tech side figuring out which <span>javascript</span>{' '}
								library or framework is better to achieve the specific goal. I like the flexibility of{' '}
								<span>React</span> and its whole ecosystem, <span>styled components</span> and the{' '}
								<span>stylesheet</span> declinations (obviously <span>SCSS</span> remain the king), all
								connected togheter by <span>headless API</span> with content managed through an{' '}
								<span>headless CMS</span> and released as <span>responsive</span> products ready for
