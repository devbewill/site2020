We’re very excited to release a complete Studio design revision. We have been careful not to break existing workflows while laying a better foundation for what’s to come. This new Studio is made to adapt when new features come along and to better accommodate upcoming plugins, tools, and extensions. It still built in React, it still has a real-time user interface, and it’s still open source and still deploys as a static bundle that can be hosted anywhere that can serve up a file. With this release, we feel pretty confident that we ship the world’s best content management system for both developers and content editors alike.
